# Monetization Strategy

This document outlines the monetization strategy for the Parallel You app, centered around a freemium subscription model.

### 1. **Subscription Tiers**

We will offer two tiers: a **Free** tier to attract a wide user base and a **Premium** tier with advanced features for engaged users.

    *   **Goal:** To let users experience the core value of the app with minimal friction.

        *   Ability to track up to **three (3)** habits simultaneously.
        *   Basic analytics.

*   **Premium Tier (Monthly/Annual Subscription):**
    *   **Goal:** To provide continuous value and powerful tools for users serious about their personal development.

### 3. **How to Maximize Conversions**

Our strategy is to demonstrate overwhelming value in the free tier and then strategically upsell at key moments.

*   **Initial Upsell:** After the user generates their first future self and roadmap, show a beautifully designed paywall explaining the benefits of the AI coach and unlimited habits to help them *actually achieve* this future.
*   **Contextual Upsells:**
    *   When a user tries to create a fourth habit, prompt them to upgrade.
    *   When a user wants to explore another career path, prompt them to upgrade for unlimited generations.
    *   Periodically, the UI can contain a subtle, non-intrusive CTA to "Ask the AI Coach for help" which would lead to the paywall if the user is on the free tier.
*   **"Free Trial" of Premium Features:** Offer a 7-day free trial for the premium plan to let users experience the full power of the app, especially the AI coach.
*   **Email Nurturing:** For users who sign up but don't subscribe, send a series of emails showcasing success stories and the benefits of the premium features.

### 4. **Pricing Strategy**

*   **Monthly Subscription:** **$9.99 / month**
    *   Targets users who want to try out the premium features without a long-term commitment.
*   **Annual Subscription:** **$59.99 / year**
    *   **Value Proposition:** Offers a significant discount (around 50% off the monthly price), encouraging longer-term commitment. This should be highlighted as the "Best Value" option.
*   **Pricing Rationale:** The price point is competitive with other self-improvement and productivity apps. It's high enough to be sustainable but low enough to be an impulse purchase for someone serious about their goals. We are selling a transformation, not just an app.
*   **Localization:** Prices will be adjusted based on the user's country and currency.

This freemium model allows us to build a large top-of-funnel while monetizing the most engaged segment of our user base.
